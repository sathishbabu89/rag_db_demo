Excellent start üëè ‚Äî your explanation captures the **core flow** of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system very well. Let‚Äôs refine your version using **precise RAG and LLM architecture terminology**, including the key components, stages, and vocabulary typically used in production-grade setups.

---

### üîπ Refined RAG Architecture (Step-by-Step with Correct Terminology)

#### **1. Document Ingestion / Knowledge Ingestion**

> *User uploads a PDF (or any document).*

* The document is **ingested** into the RAG system.
* This step often includes:

  * **Document parsing** ‚Äì extracting text from PDFs, Word files, etc.
  * **Preprocessing / cleaning** ‚Äì removing headers, footers, special characters, etc.

‚úÖ **Terminology**: *Ingestion Pipeline* or *Data Loader.*

---

#### **2. Text Chunking (Segmentation)**

> *The document is split into smaller parts.*

* Long text is **segmented into manageable ‚Äúchunks‚Äù** (usually 200‚Äì1000 tokens).
* This ensures that each piece of text fits into the LLM‚Äôs context window and retains coherent meaning.

‚úÖ **Terminology**: *Chunking* or *Text Segmentation.*

---

#### **3. Embedding Generation**

> *Chunks are converted into vectors.*

* Each chunk is passed through an **embedding model** (like OpenAI‚Äôs `text-embedding-3-large` or `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
* The model outputs **high-dimensional vector representations** that capture semantic meaning.

‚úÖ **Terminology**: *Embedding Generation* or *Vectorization.*

---

#### **4. Vector Storage**

> *Vectors are stored in a vector database.*

* The resulting embeddings (vectors) are stored along with metadata (chunk text, source file, etc.) in a **Vector Store**.
* Examples: **ChromaDB**, **FAISS**, **Pinecone**, **Weaviate**, **Milvus**, etc.

‚úÖ **Terminology**: *Vector Database (Vector Store)* or *Knowledge Index.*

---

#### **5. Query Processing**

> *User enters a question or prompt.*

* The user query is received by the **retrieval pipeline**.
* The query text is **converted into an embedding** using the same embedding model as before.

‚úÖ **Terminology**: *Query Embedding* or *Query Vectorization.*

---

#### **6. Similarity Search / Retrieval**

> *Compare query vector with document vectors.*

* The vector database performs a **similarity search** (e.g., cosine similarity) to find the top-*k* semantically closest chunks.
* These top chunks are **retrieved as context** relevant to the query.

‚úÖ **Terminology**: *Retriever* or *Retrieval Step.*

---

#### **7. Context Construction / Augmentation**

> *Relevant chunks are combined to give the LLM context.*

* The retrieved chunks are **concatenated or summarized** into a contextual prompt.
* This context is **‚Äúaugmented‚Äù** (added) to the user‚Äôs original question before sending it to the LLM.

‚úÖ **Terminology**: *Context Augmentation* or *Prompt Construction.*

---

#### **8. Answer Generation (LLM Response)**

> *LLM generates an answer based on the context.*

* The **LLM (Large Language Model)** takes:

  * User‚Äôs original query, and
  * Retrieved contextual documents.
* It then **generates a grounded response**, ideally based on factual information from the retrieved data.

‚úÖ **Terminology**: *Generation Step* or *Response Synthesis.*

---

#### **9. (Optional) Feedback Loop / Caching**

> *System can learn or optimize further.*

* Optionally, systems can log user feedback, cache previous responses, or rerank retrieved results.

‚úÖ **Terminology**: *RAG Optimization*, *Reranking*, *Feedback Loop.*

| 4     | **Vector Store**    | Store vectors in ChromaDB / FAISS   |
| 5     | **Query Embedding** | Convert user query to vector        |
| 6     | **Retrieval**       | Find top-*k* similar vectors        |
| 7     | **Augmentation**    | Add retrieved context to query      |
| 8     | **Generation**      | LLM generates grounded response     |

### üîπ Bonus: Key Terminologies in RAG Ecosystem

| Term                 | Meaning                                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Retriever**        | Module that fetches relevant chunks from the vector store         |
| **Generator**        | The LLM that produces the final text answer                       |
| **Context Window**   | Max tokens the LLM can ‚Äúsee‚Äù at once                              |
| **Top-k Retrieval**  | The number of most similar chunks retrieved                       |
| **Embedding Model**  | Model used to convert text into numerical vectors                 |
| **Augmented Prompt** | The final combined prompt (query + retrieved context) sent to LLM |
| **Grounded Answer**  | An LLM response supported by retrieved facts                      |
